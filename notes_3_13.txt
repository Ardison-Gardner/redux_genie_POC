Where we Are:

take user input and generate action types and basic creators

A. generate complete redux store

1. reducer and thunks
2. initial state
3. individual files for each model
4. combine reducers/create store index file

B. create from the command line- help typing issues

other ideas - logging middleware with dev flags
	    - git integration- merge conflict resolution inside the file
